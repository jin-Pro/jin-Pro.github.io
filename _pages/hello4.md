**Cruella** is a spin-off live-action film of **'101 Dalmatian Dogs'**. It moved the background to the late 70s, dealing with the youth of 'Cruella de Ville'. This is the second live-action movie with Disney villain as the main character, not the original animation character after Maleficent series.

## Soul

**Soul** is a film about a special adventure in which "Jo," who became souls in an unexpected accident, and "22," souls who don't want to go to Earth, leave together.
